    "\n",
    "As we've seen in the previous lecture, on way to evaluate a particular regression model's fit to our training data is to calculate the loss metric (either MAE, MSE or RMSE). We then say that the model with the smallest loss to fit the data the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, is the obtained results practically useful? As we'll se in this notebook, this is actually not the case. It turns out that the calculated loss metric on our training data is not a good indicator on a models usefullness. What we really want is a measure for how our model behaves on **new, unseen** data. But how can we assertain that? \n",
    "\n",
    "A well-working solution to this problem, as we'll see, is to split our data into two splits: a train- and a test split. Then we'll only use the train data to fit our model. The actual evaluation will then be done on the test data, which now simulates new, unseen data."

In our example, this is the case for the polynomial model of degree 12.\n",
